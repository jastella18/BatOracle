Idea: Create a machine learning model that processes the all-time hitting stats to predict a players stats. Specifically targeting whether or not a homerun will occur

Stats applied: Minimum 3 hitters with similar stats to desired player, and three pitchers similar to opponent.
    (ie: The Batter:
                The Comparisons:3 Batters that match/come closest to schwarbers slg, avg, ops, and pitches hit on scatterplots
            
        The Pitcher: 
                The Comparisons: 3 pitchers with same hand, pitches, strikeouts, homeruns given up, and velocities)
